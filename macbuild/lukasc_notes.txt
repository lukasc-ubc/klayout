following Brew install:
https://github.com/lukasc-ubc/klayout/tree/master/macbuild#6c-fully-homebrew-flavored-build-with-homebrew-ruby-32-and-homebrew-python-39


brew install ruby
brew install python@3.9
brew install qt@5



gdsfactory:

brew install cmake

pip3.9 install gdsfactory
- didn't work: https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory/issues/1426

worked manually:
- forked gdsfactory
- github desktop
- cd to gdsfactory folder
- python3.9
	- import gdsfactory

failed due to missing packages:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/pip3.9 install flatdict, toolz, gdstk, pydantic, omegaconf, orjson, loguru, rich, shapely, jinja2

then it works.

in KLayout, also works!
